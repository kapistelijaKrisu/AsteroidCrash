# AsteroidCrash
my very first complete project

First project to apply some kind of layering. (Even before I got into university)
I am willing to show this for the reason of showing my initiative in learning... and it always bothered me that objects didnt collide with each other. Well now i know why. 

Things to do from todays perspective.
Separate input from logic so it is event driven and in general has many things to refactor..
Manual. Enter to restart, Esc to go to previous menu or exit, left button shoot, wasd-keys to move.
Add spatial partinioning to it to increase efficiency (Learnt of this techonolgy after I completed the game).
As I had troubles with filewriter when exporting I gave up on it and it doesnt permanently save high scores. but now i know it's supposed to be written elsewhere and not inside the jar.
