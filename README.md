# AsteroidCrash
my very first complete project

First project to apply some kind of layering. (Even before I got into university)
I am willing to show this for the reason of showing my initiative in learning... and it always bothered me that objects didnt collide with each other. Well now i know why. One day I'll add spatial partinioning to it to increase efficiency (Learnt of this techonolgy after I completed the game).
