# AsteroidCrash
my very first complete project!

Things to do from todays perspective. </br>
Separate input from logic so it is event driven and in general has many things to refactor..</br>
Manual. Enter to restart, Esc to go to previous menu or exit, left button shoot, wasd-keys to move.</br>
Add spatial partinioning to it to increase efficiency (Learnt of this techonolgy after I completed the game).</br>
As I had troubles with filewriter when exporting I gave up on it and it doesnt permanently save high scores. but now i know it's supposed to be written elsewhere and not inside the jar.
